    "The following analysis runs through a large dataset containing details about fifteen high schools. The data was analyzed through district, school, highest-performing schools, lowest-performing schools, math scores by grade, reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this analysis, the highest-performing schools that had the most students pass with their math and reading scores above 70 were concluded to be of the charter school type. The secret to their success may be due to having excellent teachers distributed across all grades, because all of these highest-performing schools had 83% and above students pass with their math and reading scores in the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades."
